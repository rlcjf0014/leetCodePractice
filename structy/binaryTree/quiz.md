1) What are two different ways to implement a dfs?

A: Iteratively using an explicit stack or recursively utilizing the underlying call stack

2) What does the word 'binary' mean in 'binary tree'?

A: Each node in a binary tree has at most two children. 

3) What data structures are used to implement dfs and bfs?

A: Stack and Queue

4) In binary tree, what term is used to describe the noddes that have no children?

A: Leaf

5) In a binary tree, what term is used to describe the single node that has no parent?

A: Root

6) What is the least number of nodes a binary tree may have?

A: Zero nodes. The empty tree is considered as a binary tree; this is useful thinking for recursive algorithms.
